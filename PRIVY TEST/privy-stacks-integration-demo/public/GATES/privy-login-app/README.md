# Privy Login App (Drop-in Folder)

Copy your existing Privy app files into this directory.

Expected flow:
1. User lands on `stacks-hub-welcome.html`
2. Clicks `Onboard` -> `login-email.html`
3. Privy auth runs from this folder
4. On success, redirect to your main app page

Suggested entry file: `index.html`
